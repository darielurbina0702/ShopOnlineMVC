This project has the idea of an e-commerce web site, but for time reasons i did not have enough 
time to finished.

Customer  and  administrator registration  are working but i got an small problem while creating  administrator
the problem is related with modelState.IsValid and is in AccountController\ Register Action so i commented
(bad practice) is just to let you test the web site


This web site is not responsive , so in my github account there is another project call
CoffeShop that is responsive

Thank you very much for your help , this time was great and i learned a lot , i hope this is not going to
be last time that i can see you all and we can keep in touch.
